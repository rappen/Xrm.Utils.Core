# Xrm.Utils.Core

Project contains various useful extensions that will help develop Dataverse/365/CRM-reladed code faster.

The code is organized as three separate assemblies:

* **Xrm.Utils.Core.Common** — most generic extensions that could be used in console applications, working with Dynamics CRM, [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/) plugins, as well as in regular CRM plugins and workflows;
* **Xrm.Utils.Core.Plugin** — classes and extensions specific to the CRM plugins development;
* **Xrm.Utils.Core.Workflow** — classes and extensions specific to the CRM workflows development;

## History
These helpers have been envolved during 10-15 years, started when we were at Cinteros, then at Innofactor, and now we are not hooked to any company anymore, but it has to keep improving it...
